# Hello! I'm Alper

I'm a **First-Year Engineering Student** at [Monash University Australia](https://www.monash.edu/), with a passion for **Embedded Systems** and **Python**. I'm actively building projects to expand my knowledge in embedded C/C++ and low-level hardware integration.


## Current Projects 

- **Raycasting Engine:** Currently running on Arduino, with plans to port to **ESP32/Pi Pico** for a full game engine development. 
- **LinkedIn Queens Solver:** A Python-based solution developed to assist with my LinkedIn Queens streak.
